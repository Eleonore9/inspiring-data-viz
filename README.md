# Inspiring data viz projects


This is the repo for a lightning talk at the Stockholm Data Viz meetup
group (29/05/2018).

At the [OpenVisConf](http://openvisconf.com/) 2018 I got super inspired by the projects displayed.
I present a short take-away from the conference and insist on the projects I saw at the ["1, 2, 3 DATA" exhibition](https://123data.paris/collection) (where one of the conferences speaker exposed).
